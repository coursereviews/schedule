     "description": "Introduction to American Studies: American Holidays In this course we will offer an introduction to the interdisciplinary study of American culture and identity. Integrating a range of sources and methods, we will examine myths, symbols, values, and social changes that have been used to create and contest ideas of "Americanness." This year we will focus on holidays, both secular and religious, and how they have been celebrated or observed in the U.S., past and present, privately and publicly. With a multifaith and multiethnic scope, we will consider holidays such as Easter, Purim, Passover, Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr, Yom Kippur, and Diwali, as well as largely-secular holidays such as Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, Halloween, and Thanksgiving. We will also compare and contrast a variety of New Year festivities as they are celebrated by immigrant and diasporic communities. Sources for the course will include greeting cards, advertisements, magazine illustrations, decorations, cookbooks and recipes, genre paintings, music, photographic documentation of parades and festivals, and objects related to the celebration and observation of religious holidays from a variety of faiths and traditions. 3 hrs. lect.",

Many of those dramatists (such as Ridgely Torrence, Eugene O’Neill, Paul Green, George Sklar, Molly Kazan, Howard Sackler, Martin Duberman, Lanford Wilson, Tony Kushner, and Rebecca Gilman) tackled prevalent black issues, receiving respect and appreciation from diverse audiences. In this course students will examine works by white playwrights who dramatized topical issues pertaining to the social and political experience of African Americans.",

In this course we will explore the memorializing impulse; the complexity and depth of emotion evoked by memorial acts; and the oftentimes heated controversies about modes, placement, and subject of representation.  We will consider how and why America chooses to memorialize certain people and events, and what is gained—and sometimes erased—in the process.  By choosing among a broad range of traditional and non-traditional modes of representation, we will consider how public memorials both reflect and shape Americans’ shared cultural values.  The course will include site visits to local monuments and projects in which we propose designs or redesigns of memorials for a 21st century audience.",

The incised line in the plate holds the ink while the surface is wiped clean. Only the line prints when paper is placed on the plate and both are run through the etching press. The course is augmented by slide lectures to provide the students with a thorough background in the intaglio medium as well as other drawing based mediums.

Our approach will be two-fold:  We will make glazed-ceramic portrait sculptures, which will be used as the basis for large-scale oil paintings. In doing so, we will learn how artists throughout history made oil paintings by creating and using visual source material. Our paintings will, as the need arises, integrate three-dimensional additions made from fired-ceramic, enameled copper, and/or fused glass. In these ways we will explore concepts of decoration, jewelry, and clothing. We will use digital photography throughout to record, analyze, and invent. In addition to weekly image-based lectures on the history of portraiture and design, the class will be include close, individual instruction within a collaborative workshop atmosphere.

The course follows the history and methods of studying individual and social behaviors like feeding, courtship, mating, parental care, defense, predation, and migration. We examine live animals in the field and lab to illustrate such processes as instinct, learning, and communication. Discussion topics include behaviorism, intelligence, and sociobiology, analytical methods from tracking animals in the field to computerized motion analysis in the lab are utilized, and students design their own research projects.

     "description": "Seminar in Classical Literature: The Humanism of Herodotus Herodotus (485-424 BC), “the Father of History,” is also regarded as the first sociologist and ethnographer. The plan and argument of his work, however, including its many fantastic stories, disclose a philosophic intention that resists easy categorization. Herodotus’ subject is the “Greek miracle”: how the tiny and fractious cities of Greece took concerted action against the overwhelming might of the Persian kings who invaded Greece in 490 and 479 BC. The story of this unlikely triumph of political freedom and limited government over despotic empire is told against the background of the Afro-Asiatic origins of Greek civilization, which Herodotus uncovers in wide-ranging investigations of the customs and religions of Greece, Lydia, Media, Persia, Egypt, Libya, and Scythia. In this seminar we will pursue a close reading of Herodotus in translation; the seminar is open to all students with some previous background in Greek and/or Roman literature. 3 hrs. sem.",

We will discuss a range of works by writers such as Chinua Achebe, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, J. M. Coetzee, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Assia Djebar, Frantz Fanon, Hanif Kureishi, Nadine Gordimer, C.L.R. James, Jamaica Kincaid, George Lamming, Ngugi Wa Thiong'o, Rohinton Mistry, Arundhati Roy, Salman Rushdie, Edward Said, Zadie Smith, and Wole Soyinka.

Why should such strange mélanges of the quotidian and the supernatural strike so many authors as the perfect vehicle to express 20th and 21st century anxieties and possibilities?  We will explore examples of these boundary-defying fictions across several decades and various national literatures.  Authors to be studied will include Woolf, Kafka, Calvino, Morrison, Pynchon, Rushdie, and Garcia-Marquez.",

We will study closely how pauperized, sexualized, hyper-urbanized, conflicted, and violent globalizing worlds demand specific techniques of cinematic storytelling that often cut across the genres of auteur, fantasy/sci-fi, kitsch, gangster, political, drama, and indie. With this knowledge of the blurring of aesthetics and categories, we will watch Ritwik Ghatak’s Jukti, Takko, ar Gappo (Reason, Argument, and a Story, India), Wong-Kar-Wai’s Chungking Express (Hong Kong), Tranh Anh Hung’s Cyclo (Vietnam), Tareque Masud’s Matir Moyna (The Clay Bird, Bangladesh), Neill Blomkamp’s District 9 (South Africa), Bela Tarr’s Sátántangó (Hungary), Pedro Costa’s Colossal Youth (Portugal), and Kim Longinotto’s Salma (Britain). Students will come to understand cinematic techniques in the context of politics of filmmaking and film criticism today.  We will read selections from critical film theory, postcolonial film criticism, psychoanalysis, and new media. Reading list includes Laura Marks, Jacques Ranciere, Trinh Minh-ha, Gayatri Spivak, Ritwik Ghatak, Satyajit Ray, Ravi Vasudevan, Kaja Silverman, Christian Keathley, Ulka Anjaria, and others.",

In the first part of the course we will review economic models of the household, fertility, and labor supply and discuss how they help us interpret long-term trends in marriage and divorce, fertility, and women’s labor-force participation. In the second part of the course we will study economic models of wage determination and focus on explanations of, and policy remedies for, earnings differentials by gender. The final part of the course will focus on new research in economics on gender-related topics.   (ECON 0155) 3hrs. lect.",

What effects do government policies have on incentives for firms, individuals, and others in the private sector? The course will cover a wide range of issues in public economics with a primary focus on current policy debates in the United States, employing standard empirical and theoretical tools used in public economic research.

We will look at not only the traditional Anglo-American experience but also that of Native Americans, Chinese, Indian, and others.  Readings will include works by John Knowles, P. G.

In this course we will approach mathematics and science learning as the construction of ideas rather than the memorization of facts, rules and procedures.  We will investigate the mathematical and scientific reasoning of young people and how to construct learning experiences to support students’ conceptual development and ability to communicate in mathematical and scientific ways. We will also explore how a social justice stance enables math and science to be a source of empowerment for students.  Many class sessions occur on site at a local elementary school (transportation provided). This partnership allows students to ground their thinking about the role of schools in a democratic society within the workings of a local school and provides consistent practice and supportive feedback on authentic components of teaching.  In addition to class sessions, students will complete field experiences in a K-6 classroom in the Middlebury area. 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.",

In this course we will study the most significant of these plays together with critical and historical readings that reveal the full extent of English encounters with the Ottoman empire and the Arab world in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with attention to the construction of race, ethnicity, and national identity. Readings will include Peele, Greene, Daborne, Massinger, Heywood, Dekker, Marlowe, and Shakespeare, among others. 3 hrs. sem. (Diversity)/",

In this course we will investigate how American meanings of nature have changed from European-Native contact to the present.  These questions will be addressed from multi-disciplinary perspectives in the humanities and will include attention to race, class, gender, and environmental justice. Topics and readings may include: Native American authors, Emerson, Thoreau, Marsh, Muir, Leopold, and Carson, as well as rural, urban, pastoral, and marine ecological contexts. 3 hrs. lect.",

We will read these works using the tools of modern ecocriticism (with an emphasis on class, race, gender, ecology, and environmental justice) while also striving to understand these works in historical context. Topics include the microscopic and the macrocosmic, “freaks” of nature, the human/animal, bestiaries and early zoography, angling, hunting, hawking, the pastoral, country houses, harvest festivals, fair land use and enclosure, poetic inspiration, human anatomy, biological determinism, and artifice.

     "description": "Cinema in a Globalizing World In this course we will study cinema as everyday narrative deepening our relationship with a globalizing world. We will study closely how pauperized, sexualized, hyper-urbanized, conflicted, and violent globalizing worlds demand specific techniques of cinematic storytelling that often cut across the genres of auteur, fantasy/sci-fi, kitsch, gangster, political, drama, and indie. With this knowledge of the blurring of aesthetics and categories, we will watch Ritwik Ghatak’s Jukti, Takko, ar Gappo (Reason, Argument, and a Story, India), Wong-Kar-Wai’s Chungking Express (Hong Kong), Tranh Anh Hung’s Cyclo (Vietnam), Tareque Masud’s Matir Moyna (The Clay Bird, Bangladesh), Neill Blomkamp’s District 9 (South Africa), Bela Tarr’s Sátántangó (Hungary), Pedro Costa’s Colossal Youth (Portugal), and Kim Longinotto’s Salma (Britain). Students will come to understand cinematic techniques in the context of politics of filmmaking and film criticism today.  We will read selections from critical film theory, postcolonial film criticism, psychoanalysis, and new media. Reading list includes Laura Marks, Jacques Ranciere, Trinh Minh-ha, Gayatri Spivak, Ritwik Ghatak, Satyajit Ray, Ravi Vasudevan, Kaja Silverman, Christian Keathley, Ulka Anjaria, and others.",

Instead of studying the famous "big novels" of the period, we will choose to uncover contradictions present in nineteenth century ideology.

Contemporary events are still refracted through the prism of a past that, as one historian has noted, does not seem to go away. We will focus on a critical aspect of that past, the French Resistance, a politically and socially diverse underground movement that took root in a divided nation under the collaborationist Vichy regime and German occupation.  What forms did refusal take, how did resistance function, and what motivated resisters to risk their lives?  We will examine the myths, realities, and legacy of the Resistance through original documents and period artifacts, memoirs and testimony, film and fiction, and seminal works of postwar historiography.  Students will produce a significant piece of independent research to present to the class. (Open to French Senior Majors). 3 hrs. lect/disc.",

We shall consider questions related to religious and psychological experience such as: Where does the self reside? Why is it important to “know thyself”? What is the state of consciousness described as enlightenment? How does one rise above the sorrows and struggles of the world?  Finally, we shall try to understand how turning within does not mean fleeing from the world, but engaging in the world around us in a more profound and meaningful way.

Throughout, we will focus on the spatial basis of society, its continual reorganization through time, and how various human and environmental problems can be usefully analyzed from a geographic perspective.

How will developing countries with high sensitivity and few resources manage to adapt to a changing climate?  Geography is uniquely suited to research social dimensions of climate change by integrating human and physical geography in the traditions of hazards, human-environment systems, and political ecology research.  In this seminar we will contrast approaches to three related concepts: resilience, vulnerability, and adaptation.  We will review their use in current academic research and literature, international climate negotiations, and adaptation planning and financing in least developed countries.  We will culminate the seminar with independent research into a particular case of planned climate change adaptation in a least developed country.  (Senior majors only, or by approval)",

Grounded in Dadaism, the Beat Generation, and Pop Art, its young authors attacked the literary establishment and its highbrow dogma with works bridging the gap between high and low culture. In this course, we will investigate the crossover characteristics of Popliteratur, reading it as the literary equivalent of pop music, with an eye to American influence on pop culture in postwar Germany. Through theoretical lenses ranging from Adorno's classic Kulturindustrie to Fiedler's Playboy article, "Cross the Border, Close the Gap"! we will examine primary works by Brinkmann, von Stuckrad-Barre, and Meinecke alongside other products of pop culture, particularly of the last decade.

In the second part of the course we will study economic models of wage determination and focus on explanations of, and policy remedies for, earnings differentials by gender. The final part of the course will focus on new research in economics on gender-related topics.   (ECON 0155) 3hrs. lect.",

In this course we will explore how access to, control over, and distribution of resources influence environmental and health outcomes both in terms of social inequities and ecological decline.  Specific issues we will cover include: ecofeminism, food security, population, gendered conservation, environmental toxins, climate change, food justice, and the green revolution.  We will draw comparisons between different societies around the globe as well as look at dynamics between individuals within a society.  The majority of case studies are drawn from Sub Saharan Africa and Asia, however some comparisons are also made with the United States. 3 hrs. lect.",

     "description": "Murdered Women: Politics and Literary Representation in Portugal and Brazil In this course we will study the tragic history of three women ordered to be executed by political chiefs for political reasons. The course's aim is twofold: to analyze, in their historical frameworks, the political ideologies used to justify the women's murders, and to examine through textual analysis how these events are represented in fictional and non-fictional literature. The women are Inês de Castro (1320-1355), the lover of the Portuguese Prince Pedro; Olga Benario (1908-1942), the Jewish-German wife of the Brazilian communist leader Luís Carlos Prestes; and Elza Fernandes (1918-1934), the girlfriend of a high member of the communist party in Brazil. Inês was killed because her imminent marriage to Pedro could have rendered Portugal politically unstable. Olga died in a Nazi concentration camp, to which she was sent by Prestes' enemy Getúlio Vargas, then President of Brazil. Elza was accused of political betrayal and eventually murdered by communist party members, with the support of Luís Carlos Prestes. Readings will include poetry, a biography, and a historical novel.

This is not a traditional survey; rather, it focuses on key monuments and important examples of portable and decorative arts: mosques, tombs, palaces, manuscript illumination, calligraphy, metalwork, textiles, ceramics, etc. We will consider their meanings and functions in their respective socio-historical contexts, and we will also analyze the impact of patronage and region. We will try to understand what general principles unify the richness and diversity of Islamic art: what is Islamic about Islamic art? Finally, we will address the issue of contemporary Islamic art.

In this course we will consider select Asian (Indian, Chinese, Japanese) and Islamic artworks in the Middlebury College Museum of Art’s permanent collection to explore the fundamental question: “Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?” Are standards in beauty universal, or are they always relative? We will ask how the act of beholding is entwined with cultural assumptions and conditioning and will address those assumptions through an intensive combination of close looking, critical analysis, and comparative consideration of a diverse range of artworks and aesthetic traditions. Comparisons will be made with select works of Western art in the museum. 3 hrs. lect./disc.",

In this seminar we will explore the development of minimal art across a variety of media, including painting, sculpture, film, and music. We will focus on the practices of individual artists (Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin) as well as broader theoretical arguments.

His successful domination of the eastern Mediterranean led to a new world order known as the Hellenistic Age. Under Alexander's successors, literature, art, and philosophy flourished, but a little more than a century later the Hellenistic Greeks found themselves on a collision course with Rome's expanding republic. This course will investigate the political and cultural history of the Greeks and Romans in this period and consider the forces that created the Graeco-Roman world. Readings include Arrian, the Alexandrian poets, Polybius, Livy, and Plutarch. (This course replaces CLAS/HIST 0338: The Hellenistic World and the Foundations of Graeco-Roman Culture.)",

We will read a number of controversial texts from the period, immerse ourselves in the worlds of Company and Indian politics, and do guided research using holdings in Middlebury’s Special Collections. Topics will include the rise of the Company as a trading concern, its aggressive competition with other European trading monopolies and South Asian kingdoms, and the importance of opium in its dealings with China. We will end with a discussion of the Indian rebellion of 1857. (Not open to students who have taken FYSE 1308 or HIST 1009)",

The ethnographies will focus on how different political economies and cultural interpretations of capitalism encourage people to financialize their obligations to their families, generating unsustainable business models that deepen indebtedness. 3 hrs. sem.",

Notions of time and space, order and transgression, nature and culture have long affected what people eat and how they do it. How does eating, this most basic and universal of human practices, both reflect difference and create it? How are food systems, symbolic and “real,” linked to national and international politics: Finally, how are contemporary food practices influenced by “modernization” and “globalization”?

     "description": "Mathematics and Science as Art in Contemporary Theatre In Tom Stoppard’s Arcadia, the playwright somewhat miraculously manages to use the tension between Euclidean geometry and modern fractal geometry to explore the classical/romantic dichotomy in literature, science, art, and human personality. This is just one example of how acclaimed playwrights such as Stoppard, Rinne Groff, Michael Frayn, Simon McBurney, and others have effectively incorporated mathematical and scientific themes for artistic purposes.  Our goal is to explore this relatively recent phenomenon in theater with an eye toward understanding the complementary ways in which science and art aim to seek out their respective truths.   The course is intended to be experiential in both theatrical and scientific terms; our explorations will include the staging of scenes and discussions of theatre as performance; we will also undertake labs in the various mathematical sciences related to the material within the plays.",

Does there exist an arrangement of the objects satisfying the rules?  If so, how many are there?  These are the questions of existence and enumeration.  As such, we will study the following combinatorial objects and counting techniques: permutations, combinations, the generalized pigeonhole principle, binomial coefficients, the principle of inclusion-exclusion, recurrence relations, and some basic combinatorial designs.

     "description": "Murdered Women: Politics and Literary Representation in Portugal and Brazil In this course we will study the tragic history of three women ordered to be executed by political chiefs for political reasons. The course's aim is twofold: to analyze, in their historical frameworks, the political ideologies used to justify the women's murders, and to examine through textual analysis how these events are represented in fictional and non-fictional literature. The women are Inês de Castro (1320-1355), the lover of the Portuguese Prince Pedro; Olga Benario (1908-1942), the Jewish-German wife of the Brazilian communist leader Luís Carlos Prestes; and Elza Fernandes (1918-1934), the girlfriend of a high member of the communist party in Brazil. Inês was killed because her imminent marriage to Pedro could have rendered Portugal politically unstable. Olga died in a Nazi concentration camp, to which she was sent by Prestes' enemy Getúlio Vargas, then President of Brazil. Elza was accused of political betrayal and eventually murdered by communist party members, with the support of Luís Carlos Prestes. Readings will include poetry, a biography, and a historical novel. (PGSE 0215 or equivalent) 3hrs. lect./disc.",

We will ask how this artistic Socrates relates to Nietzsche's own tragic hero, Zarathustra, and why tragedy affirms life and overcomes pessimism.

In this course we will examine what recent psychological literature tells us about the pros and cons of our wired world. We will review research on the use of cell phones, social media, video games, and the internet, and look at topics such as attention, addiction, cyber-bullying, learning, brain and mind, and relationships with friends and family. In this course we will draw on multiple areas of psychology, including social, developmental, cognitive, educational, and neuroscience, and will undertake critical analysis and understanding of research in a new field. Students will also conduct empirical research on related topics of their choice. (Open to junior and senior psychology majors, others by approval)  3 hr. sem.",

Throughout the course we read ethnographic and historical studies of various religious organizations and communities (e.g., American Protestantism, the Amish, Catholicism, Hare Krishna, Shakers, Oneida, Mormons).  3 hrs. lect./disc.",

We will also investigate Japanese reactions to Christianity in the 16th century and the appearance of "new" Japanese religions starting in the 19th century.
